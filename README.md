In this Python Project:
- websocket has been used to make connections available on the loopback IP Address and a specific port number
- On the server.py : a websocket has been made for the server and a new websocket is created when a new client is connected to the server. The server broadcasts the messages that are sent from each client to all the available clients registered on the server.
- On the client.py : each new client is connected to the server and then needs to introduce itself with a nickname. Then the client can send messages to the server to then be broadcasted.
